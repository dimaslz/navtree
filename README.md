#NavTree for Github
This extensión is for improve the navigation in github only when we need show code to learn, 
and avoid to clone it only for can show the code more quickly.

##How to use
The use is simple, once you have the extension installed, when you access to github, you can see an icon in bottom-right corner.
If you do click in this icon, the editor nav (Enav) is open and you can use the navigation like any editor.

I you need hide that, just press again the icon and Enav will desappear.

Following some captures!

##Note about use
For start, the extension is workin with github API for free, when there are a lot request by day, 
this is bloked to the next day.

Later I will try to add github authentication to solve that.

##Note about code
I know that the code is a little poor, but I wanted to get the funcionality version (WIP), the code will be improved, don't worry.
